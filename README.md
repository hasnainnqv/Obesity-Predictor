# Obesity Predictor

**Obesity Predictor** is a machine learning project that uses the [Obesity Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sabainamdar2407/obesity-dataset) on Kaggle to classify individuals into different obesity levels based on lifestyle and physical attributes.

Our goal was to compare the performance of standard machine learning algorithms implemented using both:
1. **Python libraries** (e.g., `scikit-learn`)
2. **Our own from-scratch implementations** using core Python

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers on the obesity classification task
- Understand the inner workings of each algorithm by building custom versions
- Compare custom implementations with Python package versions

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We used the **Obesity Dataset** available on Kaggle, which contains anonymized data about:
- Physical measures (height, weight)
- Lifestyle habits (eating, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking)
- Demographics (gender, age)

---

## ðŸ›  Models Used

Each of the following models was trained in **two ways**:
- Using **Python packages** (e.g., `scikit-learn`)
- Using **custom Python code** from scratch

### âœ… Algorithms:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**

## ðŸ§ª Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing obesity levels distribution
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature-wise trends and outliers

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrices
   - Performance comparison: package vs. custom implementation

## ðŸ™‹ About This Project

This was a team-based learning project focused on developing machine learning models **from the ground up**. We gained both hands-on experience with Python libraries and a deeper understanding by implementing core algorithms ourselves.
